## A simple finite volume tool written in Julia
This code is a Matlabesque implementation of my Matlab finite volume tool. The code is not in its most beautiful form, but it works if you believe my words. Please remember that the code is written by a chemical/petroleum engineer. Petroleum engineers are known for being simple-minded folks and chemical engineers have only one rule: "any answer is better than no answer".

## Installation
Go to your `.julia` folder and type
```
git clone https://github.com/simulkade/JFVM.git
```
## Tutorial
Finally I managed to write a short [tutorial](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/simulkade/JFVM/blob/master/examples/jfvm_tutorial.ipynb)
